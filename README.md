This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the analysis for the manuscript "Temporal and phenological modulation of the impact of increasing drought conditions on vegetation growth in a humid big river basin: insights from global comparisons"

#The code is structured in the sequence it is used in the analysis.
1.Calculation of SPI/PET/SPEI
2.Calculation of trends of drought frequency and NDVI-SPEI correlation
3.Calculation of NDVI anomaly
4.Calculation of Phenology metrics
